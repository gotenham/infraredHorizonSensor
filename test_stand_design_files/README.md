To assess the utility of the prototype infrared horizon sensor, a simulated infrared view of Earths orbital horizon was designed;
with the following configuration:
	a) LEO orbital altitude of 600-800km;
	b) 55° x 35° sensor FOV;
	c) Viewed from the nominal orientation.
	
The prototype was mounted to a controllable pitch and roll gimbal while viewing the simulated orbital view. 
By adjusting the sensors roll and pitch by known quantities, the horizon sensors attitude estimation relative to the nadir vector of the simulated view can be evaluated.
The final test stand is comprised of two key components, the proxy infrared orbital view that the prototype will perceive, and the controllable pitch-roll gimbal 
that the prototype is mounted within; the design considerations of both are detailed in thesis sections "2.3 Orbital View Test Stand".
